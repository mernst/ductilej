TypelessJ TODO
--------------

Detyper
- Transform constructor invocations (JCNewClass)
- Implement signature mangling
- Need to handle static imports (hopefully we won't need to differentiate
between members and methods)
- Extract main() detection into ASTUtil, make it correct
- Record original type information when transforming JCVariableDecl, somehow
pass that along to all runtime methods so that they can provide better feedback
- Record original type information when transforming JCMethodDecl and store
that in annotations preserved at runtime for use by RT.invoke()

Runtime
- Implement RT.compare()
- Finish implementation of RT.op()
- Make use of type information everywhere possible to validate types before
calling typed library methods (transformed methods as well)
