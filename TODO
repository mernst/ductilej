TypelessJ TODO
--------------

Detyper
- Detect that a method implements a library interface, avoid transform
- Transform method calls with implicit receivers (which are JCIdent rather than
JCFieldAccess)
- Record original type information when detyping JCVariableDecl, somehow pass
that along to all runtime methods so that they can provide better feedback
- Extract main() detection into ASTUtil, make it correct
- Record original type information when detyping JCMethodDecl and store that in
annotations preserved at runtime for use by RT.invoke()
- Add a compile-time visible annotation to classes that have been detyped, use
that in ASTUtil.isLibrary() to determine library class status

Runtime
- Implement RT.compare()
- Finish implementation of RT.op()
- Make use of type information everywhere possible to validate types before
calling typed library methods (or detyped methods as well)
