TypelessJ TODO
--------------

Open issues
- Can't reflectively create anonymous inner classes (duh), maybe should rethink
all class creation and just inject type tag arguments in place and leave things
otherwise non-reflective
- Exceptions need a rethink (try to compile ThrowsTest)
- How to handle switch (can't just switch ((Integer)exp) because of enums)?
-- Transform into a for{} and some if()s?
- What math ops are legal for Character (+ and -, but * and /?)
- Need to avoid passing array as sole final argument to RT.invoke and
RT.invokeStatic, can happen when passing an argument in an untransformed method
and for literals:
-- main(String[] args) { foo(args); }
-- foo(new String[] { ... })
- We need to preserve statically visible assignment to final class members in
the constructor
-- "foo = 5" is OK, but "this.foo = 5" gets turned into a reflective
assignment, perhaps we should just not do that for this.foo when inside
constructors... I don't like the special case, maybe we never do it for
this.foo

Detyper
- Need to handle SomeClass.foo.bar in visitSelect()
- Convert postfix incr/decr into (v = (e = e + 1) - 1)
- Handle array creation (new type[expr] -> new type[(Integer)expr])
- Insert cast to proper return type for overridden library methods
- I think we don't need to annotate anonymous inner classes, confirm this
- Implement signature mangling
- Extract main() detection into ASTUtil, make it correct
- Record original type information when transforming JCVariableDecl, somehow
pass that along to all runtime methods so that they can provide better feedback
- Record original type information when transforming JCMethodDecl and store
that in annotations preserved at runtime for use by RT.invoke()

Runtime
- Finish implementation of RT.unop(), RT.binop()
- Make use of type information everywhere possible to validate types before
calling typed library methods (transformed methods as well)
- We need to convert Object[] back to the requested type of the receiver when
passing an array into a library method

Later
- Ambiguous overload handling, use this approach:
-- http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-March/004921.html
- How to better handle typos? (throw new IOExceptio("Foo") fails with 'cannot
find symbol' (since it's RT.newClass(IOExceptio.class, "Foo")) which is a
little funny...
- Consider making all transformed members public instead of using
setAccessible() in our reflective calls. This would make TJ usable for applets
and such.
